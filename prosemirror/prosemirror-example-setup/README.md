This module exports helper functions for deriving a set of basic menu
items, input rules, or key bindings from a schema. These values need
to know about the schema for two reasonsâ€”they need access to specific
instances of node and mark types, and they need to know which of the
node and mark types that they know about are actually present in the
schema.
